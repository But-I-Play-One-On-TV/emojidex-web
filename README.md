emojidex-coffee
===============
emojidex-coffee contains coffeescript sources which compile into a set of javascript jQuery 
modules. Anyone can use these modules on their site to enable emoji without any complex 
bundling or dealing with image assets or server-side processing. A variety of tools are 
included which allow emojidex to be used for display in a variety of ways, automatic 
conversion from emoji codes, and various types of emoji input tools and widgets.


Building
--------
You will need node with a usable npm, grunt, bower. In general grunt and bower should be 
installed globally or should be present and usable in your path. We'll assume you have a 
working node/npm that you either installed using your package manager or built yourself.

### Get the source
