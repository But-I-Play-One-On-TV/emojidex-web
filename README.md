emojidex-web
============
emojidex-web provides a variety of tools and widgets to quickly incorporate emojidex 
into any website or JavaScript based app. It's written in CoffeeScript and SLIM which 
compiles into a JavaScript module that can be easily included into your project.  
  
By default all emoji assets are dynamically loaded from the emojidex CDN and dynamically 
cached by the client. There is no need to store any assets on your own server or bundle 
them with your app. The module is self contained and enclosed and should not interfere 
with other components of your site or app.
