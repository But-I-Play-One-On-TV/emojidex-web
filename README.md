emojidex-coffee
===============
emojidex-coffee contains coffeescript sources which compile into a set of javascript jQuery 
modules. Anyone can use these modules on their site to enable emoji without any complex 
bundling or dealing with image assets or server-side processing. A variety of tools are 
included which allow emojidex to be used for display in a variety of ways, automatic 
conversion from emoji codes, and various types of emoji input tools and widgets.
